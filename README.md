 for #Regression 
I just showed how to use Neura Network for Regression on Boston House data set and how to vilidate your Network.

another Code is provided for #Classification using Mnist data set.
I tried to show how to preprocess your data and lables like One Hot encoding lables or normalaize and reshaping images.
how to make your Neural Network Layers, how to fit and compile ,optimize, using Callbacks like Early stoping and other patameters.
